           <p>Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.Sometimes when you innovate, you make mistakes. It is best to admit them quickly, and get on with improving your other innovations. Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.
           <br/>

           Sometimes life is going to hit you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them. Things don't have to change the world to be important.We made the buttons on the screen look so good you'll want to click them.

           <br/>
           We do not get a chance to do that many things, and every one should be really excellent. Because this is our life. Life is brief, and then you die, you know? And we have all chosen to do this with our lives. So it better be damn good. It better be worth it. </p>
